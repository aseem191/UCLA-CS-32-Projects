# UCLA CS 32 Projects


Project 3 (NachenBlaster): A game in C++, for which I had to implement game controller logic and classes for the player and enemies using object-oriented design, inheritance, polymorphism, and the STL (vectors). Actor.cpp and Actor.h contain classes and implementations for the game characters and components, while StudentWorld.cpp and StudentWorld.h contain the class and implementation for the game controller.


Project 4 (Cracked): A decrypter I wrote in C++, for which I created hash tables, linked lists, and stacks to decrypt sentences using a one-to-one letter mapping and a dictionary. MyHash.h contains my implementation of a dynamically resizing and templated hash table, Translator.cpp contains my implementation of a linked list based stack, and Decrypter.cpp contains a recursive method to decrypt sentences using the other data structures.
