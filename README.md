# UCLA CS 32 Projects


Project 3 (NachenBlaster): A game in C++, for which I had to implement game controller logic and classes for the player and enemies using object-oriented design, inheritance, polymorphism, and the STL (vectors).


Project 4 (Cracked): A decrypter I wrote in C++, for which I created hash tables, linked lists, and stacks to decrypt sentences using a one-to-one letter mapping and a dictionary.
